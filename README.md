# Leaf_Recognition_RealLifeProblem

# Install
This project files requires Python 3 and the following Python libraries installed:
* https://opencv.org/  

# Problem 
The leaf recognition is one of the most challenging problems in computer vision because of almost similar shape, texture and color of the leaves.There has been a lot of work done using various traditional machine learning algorithm and hand-made leaves features. 
But in this challenge, I tried to make an end-to-end deep learning model for multi-class leaf recognition from scratch.

# Challenges
Looking at the dataset the images were highly augmented and was seemingly captured from different orientations.
